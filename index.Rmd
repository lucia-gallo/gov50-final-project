## Project thoughts

I'm interested in exploring data related to polling during the 2022 midterms and looking at public opinion data. I'd especially like to focus on New York, a reliably blue state, where the Republican Party was able to make significant gains in the House. The Republican Party was able to flip two Long Island House seats, solidifying all four seats on Long Island as Republican. I'd love to look at public opinion polls polling New Yorkers related to issues Republicans campaigned on in the months leading up to the election, in addition to any data available regarding people's opinions on the candidates running.
